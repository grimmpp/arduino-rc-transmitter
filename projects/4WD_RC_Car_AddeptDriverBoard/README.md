The software for this 4WD Remote Control Car is compatible to the [RC Transmitter](/projects/RC_Transmitter) project. 

The mounting of the motors and the frame where the Arduino Uno sits on is 3d-printed. You can also find the project for the 3d-printed parts on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3301216).

Part List:
* 2x 3d-printed mountings for motors - [MotorMounting_Bridge2_length100_4scewHoles.stl](https://github.com/grimmpp/tt-motor-mounting/blob/master/MotorMounting_Bridge2_length100_4scewHoles.stl)
* 1x 3d-printed frame - [simpleBaseFrame.stl](https://github.com/grimmpp/tt-motor-mounting/blob/master/simpleBaseFrame.stl)
* 4x Gear TT Motor for Arduino
* Arduino Uno
* [Adeept Motorsheeld](http://www.adeept.com/motorshield-for-uno_p0088.html)
