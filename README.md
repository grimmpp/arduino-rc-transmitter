# Arduino RC Transmitter

This project started because I was not completely able to decrypt the protocol of a simple RC transmitter which I already owned. I decided to build the electronics by my own, replaced the existing board, and reused the body and its buttons also because I wanted to it more feature rich.

# Setup
The board has two controllers (Arduino Nano). The right one is listening for input signals (buttons and joysticks) and sends them periodically to the left one which controls the TFT-display and the 2.4GHz antenna.
