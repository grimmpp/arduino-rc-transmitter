The software for this 4WD Remote Control Car is compatible to the RC Transmitter in the main project. 

The mounting of the motors and the frame where the Arduino Uno sits on is 3d-printed.

Part List:
* 2x 3d-printed mountings for motors
* 1x 3d-printed frame
* 4x Gear TT Motor for Arduino
* Arduino Uno
* [Adeept Motorsheeld](http://www.adeept.com/motorshield-for-uno_p0088.html)
* Transceiver NRF24l01 + Antenna
* A few screws and cables
